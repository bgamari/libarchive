# libarchive

This contains partial Haskell bindings around
[libarchive](http://libarchive.org/). It was created because the
[tar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tar) package has many bugs, but it is
not as sophisticated; in particular, it does not provide the same streaming
abilities that `tar` does.
